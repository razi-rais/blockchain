## [Blockchain Development Workshop | Wallets, Tokens & Privacy (zk-SNARKS)](https://github.com/razi-rais/blockchain-workshop)

Hands-on workshop with a focus on programming blockchain using solidity. Topics working with multi-signature wallets, writing secure contracts using 3rd party libraries OpenZeppelin, Tokens (fungible and non-fungible), writing contract following EIP20 token standard and sharing tokens to EOA and contracts. Privacy and role of zero-knowledge proofs to not reveal the sensitive data to the verifier. Creating a proof (you are over-age-of-21) using ZoKrates and deploy the verification of age as a contract on Ethereum blockchain. Verifier will not know your date of birth, but still able to verify that you are over the 21 years old.
