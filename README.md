Presentation slides, demos and useful resources from NYC meetup on Blockchain for Developers:  https://www.meetup.com/msftcloud/events/241534380 


### Slides 
You can download the pdf copy of the slides. The talk was blend of demos and slides, so I mostly used the slides to level set the audience on basic cryptography topics relevant to Blockchain. Everything else was mostly demo based.

### Demos

I predominantly used REMIX (online Solidity IDE https://remix.ethereum.org) and Truffle (http://truffleframework.com) for smart contract development and deployment. You can download smart contracts .sol files that can be use directly in REMIX and also the complete truffle solution as a zip file. Also, I used both test-rpc and private Ethereum blockchain running on Azure. 

### Learning Resources 

There was good bit of Q&A so sharing links to various resources I mentioned during the talk.
